def _attribution_score(y0, y_hat, target):
	"""An internal function for calculating the ISM attributions.

	This function, which is meant to be used for ISM, will take in the
	predictions before and after substitutions and a target -- which can be
	None -- and return the position-normalized differences. Specifically,
	for each example, the differences in prediction will be normalized by
	subtracting out the per-position average, and then averaged across
	all tasks if target is None.


	Parameters
	----------
	y0: torch.Tensor, shape=(-1, n_targets)
		Model predictions for each example on the original predictions.

	y_hat: torch.Tensor, shape=(-1, len(alphabet), length, n_targets)
		Model predictions for each example for each substitution.

	target: int or slice or None
		If the user wants to subset to only some targets when calculating the
		average attribution across targets. If None, use all.

	This internal function, which is meant to be used for ISM, will take in a

	of one. 


	Parameters
	----------
	X: torch.Tensor, shape=(len(alphabet), sequence_length)
		A single one-hot encoded sequence.

	start: int
		The first nucleotide to begin making edits on, inclusive.

	end: int
		The end of the span. Edits are not made on this nucleotide at this
		index. Can be negative indexes.


	Returns

		All one-hot encoded sequences that have an edit distance of 1 from the
		original sequence.

	"""Performs in-silico saturation mutagenesis on a set of sequences.

	This function will perform in-silico saturation mutagenesis on a set of 
	sequences and return the predictions on the original sequences and each
	of the sequences with an edit distance of one on them.

	By default, this function will aggregate these predictions into an
	attribution value. This aggregation involves taking the Euclidean distance
	between the predictions before and after the substitutions and Z-score
	normalizing them across the entire example. However, this assumes that
	the model returns only a single tensor. This tensor can have multiple
	outputs, e.g., be of shape (batch_size, n_targets) where n_targets > 1,
	but the model cannot return multiple tensors.

	If you simply want the predictions before and after the substitutions
	without the method turning those into attributions because, perhaps, you
	want to define your own aggregation method, you can use `raw_outputs=True`.


	Parameters
	----------
	model: torch.nn.Module
		The PyTorch model to use to make predictions.

	X: torch.tensor, shape=(-1, len(alphabet), length)
		A set of one-hot encoded sequences to calculate attribution values
		for. The input tensor should be on the CPU.

	args: tuple or None, optional
		An optional set of additional arguments to pass into the model. If
		provided, each element in the tuple or list is one input to the model
		and the element must be formatted to be the same batch size as `X`. If
		None, no additional arguments are passed into the forward function.
		Default is None.

	start: int, optional
		The start of where to begin making perturbations to the sequence.
		Default is 0.

	end: int, optional
		The end of where to to make perturbations to the sequence. If end is
		positive, it is non-inclusive. If end is negative, it is inclusive.
		Default is -1, meaning the entire sequence.

	batch_size: int, optional
		The number of examples to make predictions for at a time. Default is 32.

	target: int or slice or None, optional
		Whether to focus on a single output/slice of outputs from the model
		when calculating attributions rather than the entire set of outputs.
		If None, use all targets when calculating distances. Default is None.  

	hypothetical: bool, optional
		Whether to return attributions for all possible characters at each
		position or only for the character that is actually at the sequence.
		Only matters when `raw_outputs=False`. Default is False.

	raw_outputs: bool, optional
		Whether to return the raw outputs from the method -- in this case,
		the predictions from the reference sequence and from each of the
		perturbations -- or the processed attribution values. Default is False.

	dtype: str or torch.dtype or None, optional
		The dtype to use with mixed precision autocasting. If None, use the dtype of
		the *model*. This allows you to use int8 to represent large data sets and
		only convert batches to the higher precision, saving memory. Defailt is None.

	device: str or torch.device, optional
		The device to move the model and batches to when making predictions. If
		set to 'cuda' without a GPU, this function will crash and must be set
		to 'cpu'. Default is 'cuda'. 

	verbose: bool, optional
		Whether to display a progress bar during predictions. Default is False.


	Returns
	-------
	attr: torch.Tensor
		Processed attribution values as the z-score normalized difference
		between the difference in predictions for the original sequence and
		the perturbed sequences.

	-- or, if raw_outputs=True --

	y0: torch.Tensor or list/tuple of torch.Tensors
		The outputs from the model for the reference sequences.

	y_hat: torch.Tensor or list/tuple of torch.Tensors
		The outputs from the model for each of the perturbed sequences.
