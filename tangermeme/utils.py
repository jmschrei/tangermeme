) -> pandas.DataFrame:
	"""Converts coordinates within a given example to those in a FASTA file.
	
	Many analyses involve extracting windows from the genome and processing them
	independently. When coordinates are identified on these windows, e.g.,
	seqlets or other spans, all that is recorded is the example index and the
	relative positions from the start of the extracted window. Frequently, though,
	one wants to know these coordinates on the original genome or other entity
	encoded in a FASTA file. This function cross-references the example indexes
	and BED-formatted locus file that the examples were extracted from to get
	the coordinates on the original sequence.
	
	This cross-referencing has several steps.
	
		(1) For each span in `example_df` pull out the chrom, start, and end
		positions in `loci_df`. If `window` is provided, do not use the start and
		end in the file but, rather, extract a window centered on the middle of the
		provided coordinates.
		
		(2) Use the chrom directly, and add the start and end coordinates to the
		start of the extracted window from step (1).
	
	This function assumes by default that `example_df` is zero-indexed, in the 
	sense that the minimum start is 0. When doing the conversion, the start and
	end are simply added to the value in `loci_df`. This means that `loci_df` can
	be either zero- or one-indexed and the resulting df will match this indexing.
	If `example_df` is one-indexed, use the optional parameter.
	
	
	Parameters
	----------
	example_df: pandas.DataFrame
		A BED-formatted dataframe where the first three columns must be the example
		index, the start, and the end coordinates. It does not matter what these
		columns are named, and there can be additional columns past these.
	
	loci_df: pandas.DataFrame
		A BED-formatted dataframe where the first three columns must be the example
		index, the start, and the end coordinates. It does not matter what these
		columns are named, and there can be additional columns past these.
		
		NOTE: some processing steps may skip over elements in BED files and return
		a tensor with fewer elements than there are entries in the original BED
		file. Please check to make sure this has not happened, or everything will
		be misaligned.
	
	window: int or None, optional
		If None, use the start and end coordinates in `loci_df` directly. If an
		integer, these start and end coordinates will be replaced with a window
		centered on the middle of these original coordinates that spans this
		window length. This is useful when processing methods extracted windows
		of uniform length from a peak file, regardless of the length of that
		peak. Default is None.
		
	one_indexed: bool, optional
		Whether `example_df` is one-indexed. If it were one-indexed, the smallest
		start value would be 1 and so 1 would have to be subtracted from each
		correction. If False, assumes that the smallest start value is 0 and no
		change needs to be made. Default is False.
		
	
	Returns
	-------
	coords_df: pandas.DataFrame
		A dataframe of corrected coordinates where the first three columns are
		chrom, start, and end, and correspond to the same coordinate system as
		in `loci_df`. Put another way, if `loci_df` contains peaks on a reference
		genome, this returned file will now contain coordinates on that reference.
		The names of the first three columns will be replaced with the names of the

	This function will take in a PWM that encodes the probabilities of each

	most likely individual sequence according to that PWM. This is done by
	taking the argmax at each position. When multiple characters at the same
	position have the maximum probability, the character in the earlier
	numerical position is chosen. If a column has a sum equal to 0 (no
	characters allowed there) the returned consensus also has entirely 0s.
