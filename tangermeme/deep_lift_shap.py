def hypothetical_attributions(multipliers, X, references):
	"""A function for aggregating contributions into hypothetical attributions.

	When handling categorical data, like one-hot encodings, the gradients
	returned by a method like DeepLIFT/SHAP may need to be modified because
	the choice of one character at a position explicitly means that the other
	characters are not there. So, one needs to account for each character change 
	actually being the addition of one character AND the subtraction of another 
	character. Basically, once you've calculated the multipliers, you need to 
	subtract out the contribution of the nucleotide actually present and then 
	add in the contribution of the nucleotide you are becomming.

	Each element in the tensor is considered an independent example 

	As an implementation note: to be compatible with Captum, each input must
	be a tuple of length 1 and the returned value will be a tuple of length 1.
	I know this sounds silly but it's the most convenient implementation choice 
	to make the function compatible across DeepLiftShap implementations.


	Parameters
	----------
	multipliers: tuple of one torch.tensor, shape=(n_baselines, 4, length)
		The multipliers/gradient calculated by a method like DeepLIFT/SHAP.
		These should include values for both the observed characters and the
		unobserved characters at each position

	X: tuple of one torch.tensor, shape=(n_baselines, 4, length)
		The one-hot encoded sequence being explained

	references: tuple of one torch.tensor, shape=(n_baselines, 4, length)
		The one-hot encoded reference sequences, usually a shuffled version
		of the corresponding sequence in X.


	Returns
	-------
	projected_contribs: tuple of one torch.tensor, shape=(1, 4, length)
		The attribution values for each nucleotide in the input.

	"""Calculate attributions for a set of sequences using DeepLIFT/SHAP.

	This function will calculate the DeepLIFT/SHAP attributions on a set of
	sequences given a model. These attributions have the additive property that
	the sum of the attributions is ~equal to the difference in prediction
	between the original sequence and the reference sequences.

	As an implementation note, the batch size refers to the number of
	example-reference pairs that are being run simultaneously. When the batch
	size is smaller than the number of references, multiple batches will be
	run per example and the attributions will only be averaged only the
	references after they have all been covered. You may want to do this if the
	model or examples are so large that only a few can fit in memory at a time.
	The result will be identical to if all examples could fit in memory and
	each batch contained all the references.

	Convergence deltas are calculated automatically for each example-reference
	pair. Theoretically, these should be zero, but may in practice just be a
	small number due to machine precision issues with non-linear models. If
	these deltas exceed a warning threshold, a non-terminating warning will be 
	issued to let you know that the deltas have been exceeded.

	NOTE: predictions MUST yield a `(batch_size, n_targets)` tensor, even if
	n_targets is 1. If your model yields something more complicated you must
	wrap the model in a small class that operates on the outputs in a manner
	that yields such a tensor, e.g., by slicing the output or summing along
	a relevant axis.


	Parameters
	----------
	model: torch.nn.Module
		A PyTorch model to use for making predictions. These models can take in
		any number of inputs and make any number of outputs. The additional
		inputs must be specified in the `args` parameter.

	X: torch.tensor, shape=(-1, len(alphabet), length)
		A set of one-hot encoded sequences to calculate attribution values
		for. 

	args: tuple or None, optional
		An optional set of additional arguments to pass into the model. If
		provided, each element in the tuple or list is one input to the model
		and the element must be formatted to be the same batch size as `X`. If
		None, no additional arguments are passed into the forward function.
		Default is None.

	target: int, optional
		The output of the model to calculate gradients/attributions for. This
		will index the last dimension of the predictions. Default is 0.

	batch_size: int, optional
		The number of sequence-reference pairs to pass through DeepLiftShap at
		a time. Importantly, this is not the number of elements in `X` that
		are processed simultaneously (alongside ALL their references) but the
		total number of `X`-`reference` pairs that are processed. This means
		that if you are in a memory-limited setting where you cannot process
		all references for even a single sequence simultaneously that the
		work is broken down into doing only a few references at a time. Default
		is 32.

	references: func or torch.Tensor, optional
		If a function is passed in, this function is applied to each sequence
		with the provided random state and number of shuffles. This function
		should serve to transform a sequence into some form of signal-null
		background, such as by shuffling it. If a torch.Tensor is passed in,
		that tensor must have shape `(len(X), n_shuffles, *X.shape[1:])`, in
		that for each sequence a number of shuffles are provided. Default is
		the function `dinucleotide_shuffle`. 

	n_shuffles: int, optional
		The number of shuffles to use if a function is given for `references`.
		If a torch.Tensor is provided, this number is ignored. Default is 20.

	return_references: bool, optional
		Whether to return the references that were generated during this
		process. Only use if `references` is not a torch.Tensor. Default is 
		False. 

	hypothetical: bool, optional
		Whether to return attributions for all possible characters at each
		position or only for the character that is actually at the sequence.
		Practically, whether to return the returned attributions from captum
		with the one-hot encoded sequence. Default is False.

	warning_threshold: float, optional
		A threshold on the convergence delta that will always raise a warning
		if the delta is larger than it. Normal deltas are in the range of
		1e-6 to 1e-8. Note that convergence deltas are calculated on the
		gradients prior to the aggr_func being applied to them. Default 
		is 0.001. 

	additional_nonlinear_ops: dict or None, optional
		If additional nonlinear ops need to be added to the dictionary of
		operations that can be handled by DeepLIFT/SHAP, pass a dictionary here
		where the keys are class types and the values are the name of the
		function that handle that sort of class. Make sure that the signature
		matches those of `_nonlinear` and `_maxpool` above. This can also be
		used to overwrite the hard-coded operations by passing in a dictionary
		with overlapping key names. If None, do not add any additional 
		operations. Default is None.

	print_convergence_deltas: bool, optional
		Whether to print the convergence deltas for each example when using
		DeepLiftShap. Default is False.

	raw_outputs: bool, optional
		Whether to return the raw outputs from the method -- in this case,
		the multipliers for each example-reference pair -- or the processed
		attribution values. Default is False.

	dtype: str or torch.dtype or None, optional
		The dtype to use with mixed precision autocasting. If None, use the dtype of
		the *model*. This allows you to use int8 to represent large data sets and
		only convert batches to the higher precision, saving memory. Defailt is None.

	device: str or torch.device, optional
		The device to move the model and batches to when making predictions. If
		set to 'cuda' without a GPU, this function will crash and must be set
		to 'cpu'. Default is 'cuda'. 

	random_state: int or None or numpy.random.RandomState, optional
		The random seed to use to ensure determinism. If None, the
		process is not deterministic. Default is None. 

	verbose: bool, optional
		Whether to display a progress bar. Default is False.


	Returns
	-------
	attributions: torch.tensor
		If `raw_outputs=False` (default), the attribution values with shape
		equal to `X`. If `raw_outputs=True`, the multipliers for each example-
		reference pair with shape equal to `(X.shape[0], n_shuffles, X.shape[1],
		X.shape[2])`. 

	references: torch.tensor, optional
		The references used for each input sequence, with the shape
		(n_input_sequences, n_shuffles, 4, length). Only returned if
		`return_references = True`.
